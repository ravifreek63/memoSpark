\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\paragraph{}
In the paper we presented detailed research on the impact of memory
pressure on the large in-memory computations. By quantifying the
detrimental impact of garbage collection on application runtime, we
provide useful insights into managing cluster level applications. We
posit that scaling horizontally by deploying more nodes with limited
memory may not scale applications as well as supporting individual nodes
with larger memory. We have also presented experiments and measured the
spectrum of object usage for a regular Spark application. We find that
the object access patterns are heavy-tailed and can be utilized to
manage memory better. Lastly, we explore further improvements in the
RDDs by building indexes on top of partitions, and show that we can
perform more efficient range queries with such design of Indexed RDDs.
